//! Mock SDR device (T-049): a SigMF recording (real ci8 capture or synthetic cf32/ci8) served
//! behind the generic device contract ([`super`]) as if it were live air seen by a HackRF One.
//! E2E and acceptance tests drive the system through it exactly as they would drive the radio
//! (docs/10 §1.1); `hk serve --device mock:<meta>`, `hk run --source mock:<meta>` and
//! `hackriffd --source mock:<meta>` select it like `hackrf`.
//!
//! # Behaviour model
//!
//! - **Capabilities:** the HackRF One descriptor (1 MHz–6 GHz, LNA/VGA/amp stages, MAX2837
//!   filters, bias tee, 8-bit ci8), driver `mock-sdr`, kind `Hardware` (it streams and retunes like
//!   a radio), receive only (`tx_capable` false), rates from `min(2 Msps, recording rate)` to
//!   `max(20 Msps, recording rate)`. No sweep mode ([`SourceControl::sweep_capability`] is `None`,
//!   `start_sweep` is `Unsupported`, as on the HackRF source today).
//! - **Retune / rate inside coverage:** coverage is the recording's usable band, `centre ±
//!   filter/2` ([`Recording::usable_bandwidth_hz`]: its baseband filter, so the recorded roll-off
//!   never reads as a floor step). It is shifted to the new centre, band-selected and resampled to
//!   the requested rate ([`dsp`]); absolute frequencies are preserved. Tuned to the recording's
//!   own centre and rate the whole recording passes through bit-exact, as the radio captured it.
//! - **Rounding noise (T-141):** recorded IQ already holds its capture's rounding noise
//!   ([`Recording::quant_power`], 1/6 code² for ci8/cu8), and served IQ is rounded to int8 again.
//!   Rendered (not passed-through) IQ first goes through a short-time spectral subtraction: each
//!   STFT bin (1024 bins at the recording's rate, sqrt-Hann, hop 512) gets the power gain
//!   `1 − quant_power / P̂`, with `P̂` the bin's level averaged over past frames (≈ 15) and ±2 bins;
//!   a frame ≳ 3× that level replaces it at once (onsets), a frame and the next ≲ 1/4 of it from the first
//!   frame past them (stops), and a restart after passing through or a dropped history re-seeds it from
//!   the history window. The rounding noise is counted once and emissions keep their power,
//!   including emissions that start or stop mid-recording: a retune at the recording's rate serves its floor PSD unchanged, and a
//!   wider rate or higher gain shows the lower rounding density a radio would. A recording whose
//!   floor is loud enough that rounding twice reads < 0.05 dB high (≥ 2.68 codes rms per ci8
//!   component, estimated once at open) skips the subtraction (T-170: it is the cost of every
//!   retuned window).
//! - **Outside coverage (whole or part of the window, or a rate wider than the recording):** the
//!   uncovered spectrum is complex white Gaussian noise at the recording's estimated floor PSD
//!   less its rounding noise (Welch median, [`Recording::floor_power`]; the output rounding adds
//!   the device's own). The provenance `antenna_port` says what was
//!   served: `mock:recording`, `mock:recording+noise` or `mock:noise` ([`Coverage`]); a coverage
//!   change is a `PROVENANCE_CHANGE`, and [`MockStats::uncovered_samples`] counts noise-filled
//!   output, a partly-covered window contributing the noise-filled fraction of its samples.
//! - **Gain:** output = served IQ × 10^((G − G_rec)/20), G = LNA + VGA + 11 dB when the amp is on
//!   (G_rec from the recording's provenance; a recording without one is taken as captured at
//!   [`UNRECORDED_GAINS`], LNA 24 / VGA 20 / amp off, and opens there), then rounded to int8
//!   with saturation like the HackRF ADC. A block whose clipped components (codes −128/127) exceed
//!   [`MockOptions::overload_clip_fraction`] marks the tune state `overload` (sticky until the next
//!   tune/gain change, a `PROVENANCE_CHANGE`), and a recording captured overloaded stays
//!   overloaded wherever recorded IQ is served. `quantisation_limited` is set when the scaled
//!   floor (with any receiver noise) is under twice the rounding noise.
//! - **Receiver noise (T-180):** below the recording's gain a radio's own noise after its gain
//!   stages does not drop with the gain, so the samples are never mostly zero codes. Served IQ
//!   (passed through or rendered) at a gain under the recording's gets complex white Gaussian
//!   noise before rounding: [`device_noise_codes2`] at the tuned VGA less the recording's own at
//!   its VGA scaled by the gain change (≈ 0.30 code² per component at VGA 20), from a seeded
//!   generator of its own. At or above the recording's gain nothing is added and the output is
//!   unchanged (bit-exact passthrough at the recording's tune and gain).
//! - **Settle:** every accepted control change skips [`MockOptions::settle_blocks`] blocks of
//!   output (like the HackRF's discarded in-flight transfer): a `GAP` with exact `dropped_before`,
//!   counted in `discarded_samples`. Stream time (and the recording) advance through it.
//! - **Losses:** [`MockSdrControl::inject_overrun`] and [`MockOptions::overrun_every`] drop output
//!   as overruns; with real-time pacing, a reader later than [`MockOptions::queue_blocks`] loses
//!   whole blocks as a radio's full queue would; a `core:global_index` gap in the recording is an
//!   overrun of the same duration. Each is a `GAP` counted in `overruns` / `dropped_samples`.
//! - **Time-compressed scenes (T-125):** a recording made of short IQ windows far apart in time
//!   (one capture per window, `core:global_index` = window start × rate, e.g. a long simulated
//!   occupancy scene rendered only at its observation schedule) is served window after window.
//!   A block never spans a recording gap: the last block of a window ends at its last sample, and
//!   the first block of the next carries `GAP` with `dropped_before` equal to the missing
//!   duration (scaled to the tuned rate), so the counter and block times jump to the next
//!   window's simulated time. Hours between windows are never synthesised, and real-time pacing
//!   does not wait them out (device losses still pace). A retune inside a window serves that
//!   window re-centred as for any recording; windows follow the recording's schedule, not the
//!   tune calls.
//! - **Pacing:** [`Pacing::RealTime`] (wall clock × speed, never pausable) or [`Pacing::Unpaced`]
//!   (accelerated and lossless: [`Source::pausable`] is `true` only then).
//! - **Time:** block times are an anchor plus the sample counter at the tuned rate (re-anchored on
//!   a rate change). [`MockClock::Recording`] anchors at the recording's first sample time and
//!   keeps its `timestamp_method`; [`MockClock::Wall`] anchors at open, method `synthetic`.
//! - **End:** [`MockEnd::Stop`] ends the stream with the recording; [`MockEnd::Loop`] splices it
//!   again (the first block after the splice carries `GAP` with `dropped_before` 0).
//! - **Faults (T-508):** [`MockFault`] makes the mock *fail* a retune the way the HackRF driver
//!   does, instead of echoing every window it is told. The HackRF source applies a posted control on
//!   the capture thread, at a block boundary, and a failed libhackrf call surfaces as the **read**
//!   returning [`SourceError::Device`] (`hackrf.rs`'s `apply_pending`), not as an error from `tune`.
//!   [`MockFault::RetuneApplyFails`] is exactly that: the control call is accepted, the change that
//!   would move the centre or the rate is refused when applied, the read errors, and the front end
//!   **stays on the tuning it had** (the stream itself keeps working, so a later read succeeds). No
//!   fault is armed by default; `hk serve --device mock:…` arms one from `HK_MOCK_FAULT`
//!   ([`MockFault::parse`]) and a test from [`MockSdrControl::arm_retune_faults`].
//!   [`MockFault::OpenAccessDenied`] (T-892) refuses the open itself, as libhackrf does when
//!   another process holds the HackRF.
//! - **Bias tee:** a flag (accepted, settles, no effect on samples). **Baseband filter:** recorded
//!   in provenance only.
//! - **Legal class:** the mock carries no class of its own. Callers derive it from the tuned window
//!   exactly as for the live radio (`hk_pipeline::class::band_class`), keeping any stricter class
//!   the recording declares.
//!
//! # Limits (unverified until HIL)
//!
//! Gain is digital scaling of what was recorded: raising it amplifies the recorded quantisation
//! noise and cannot model the front end's noise figure, LNA compression or intermodulation;
//! lowering it cannot undo clipping baked into the recording, and models the receiver's noise
//! only through the two calibrated post-gain terms of [`device_noise_codes2`] (no DC offset or
//! spurs, no amp-off mixer noise rise). The noise fill is white at the
//! floor measured in the recording's central half, so spurs, DC and the baseband-filter roll-off
//! are not synthesised outside coverage, and the floor dips ≈ 3 dB over the transition band at a
//! coverage edge. The band-select filter (≈ 60 dB, transition 8 % of the output rate) ends its
//! roll-off half a transition inside any window edge the recording extends past (T-175: centred
//! on ±rate/2 it folded recorded content just outside the window onto the opposite edge), so the
//! outer 4 % of such a side is that dip, filled with the same noise. Since T-231 it ends half a
//! transition inside the recording's **own** band edge too: a recording's spectrum is periodic at
//! its sample rate, so a roll-off straddling `centre ± rate/2` passed the alias of the opposite
//! edge and served recorded energy at a frequency the device was never on (a recording whose
//! baseband filter is narrower than its rate already had that margin). The band select, roll-off
//! included, is asserted to stay inside the recorded band at every retune. The filter adds about
//! half its length in recording samples of latency after a retune. Multi-centre recordings are
//! refused. The rounding-noise correction assumes the recording's rounding error is white and
//! independent of the signal (true once its floor is ≳ 0.5 code rms). It needs ≈ 15 frames
//! (≈ 8 k recording samples) to follow an emission's onset, a coherent tone within 20 dB of a
//! bin's floor loses a little of its amplitude to it (≈ 0.05 dB at 20 dB), it adds 1536 recording
//! samples of look-ahead while rendering, and passing through at a changed gain still rounds
//! twice. Real HackRF captures sit at ≈ 0.7 code rms per component (amp off, 20 dB VGA) to tens of
//! codes, so the second rounding matters at low gain (≈ +0.8 dB uncorrected at 0.7 code).
